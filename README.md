## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/value-object
```

## The goal

- Passing data within your code base in a structured manner.
- Provide type validation for this data.
- Support static analysis for eg. auto completion.

## Usage

Value objects are defined like so:

```php
class DummyData extends ValueObject
{
    /** @var string */
    public $name;
    
    /** @var \Spatie\ValueObject\Dummy */
    public $relation;
    
    public $everythingAllowed;
    
    /** @var null|string */
    public $nullable;
    
    /** @var mixed */
    public $mixed;
}
```

And created like so:

```php
$dummyData = new DummyData([
    'name' => 'Spatie',
    'relation' => new Dummy(),
    'everythingAllowed' => 'abc'
    'mixed' => 123,
    // 'nullable' => 'deliberately left out',
]);
```

In practice, you'll almost always will provide static constructors:

```php
class DummyData
{
    public static function fromRequest(Request $request): DummyData
    {
        return new self([
            // …
        ]);
    }
    
    public static function fromJson(string $json): DummyData
    {
        return new self([
            // …
        ]);
    }
}
```

### PHP's type system

PHP 7.4 will introduce typed class properties. 
We're making this package as closely as possible to the typed properties implementation,
so that when 7.4 comes this package will seamlessly work with typed properties, and not just doc blocks.

### A note on immutability

Value objects are meant to be only constructed once, and not changed thereafter.
You should never write data to the properties once the value object is created.

### Helper functions

Once a value object is constructed, you can read its properties like you'd normally do:

```php
$dummyData->name;

$dummyData->relation;
```

Because the properties are public, you'll have autocompletion out of the box.

There are also some helper functions provided for working with multiple properties at once. 

```php
$dummyData->all();

$dummyData
    ->only('name', 'relation')
    ->toArray();
    
$dummyData
    ->except('relation')
    ->toArray();
``` 

You can also chain these methods:

```php
$dummyData
    ->except('relation')
    ->except('name')
    ->toArray();
```

It's important to note that `except` and `only` are immutable, they won't change the original value object.

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
